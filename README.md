# Project Description
This project aims to predict the risk of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) by leveraging both traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques:

GridSearchCV: Used to perform an exhaustive search over specified hyperparameters for the CNN model. This technique helps find the best combination of parameters to improve the model’s prediction accuracy and robustness.

VGG16: A powerful pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model originally trained on ImageNet. In this project, VGG16 is used for transfer learning to extract meaningful features from the data, enabling efficient and accurate prediction even with limited training data.

CNN: A deep learning model designed and trained from scratch specifically for this cardiovascular dataset. The CNN architecture captures complex patterns and relationships within the data to classify the presence or absence of CVD.

By combining hyperparameter tuning, transfer learning, this project explores multiple approaches to improve prediction accuracy and help in early diagnosis of cardiovascular disease.
